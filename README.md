# Food Choices Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the Food Choices dataset to understand the food preferences and behaviors of different demographics. The dataset contains information about various factors influencing food choices, such as age, gender, income, and dietary habits.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and includes the following features:
- `Gender`: The gender of the respondent
- `Age`: The age of the respondent
- `Income`: The income level of the respondent
- `Diet`: The dietary preference (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian)
- `Favorite Cuisine`: The respondent's favorite type of cuisine
- `Eating Out Frequency`: How often the respondent eats out
- `Spending on Food`: Monthly spending on food
- `Health Consciousness`: Self-reported level of health consciousness
- `Food Preferences`: Various preferences related to food

## Objectives
- **Understand Demographic Trends:** Analyze how different demographics influence food choices.
- **Identify Key Factors:** Determine the key factors that influence food preferences and spending.
- **Visualize Data:** Use data visualization techniques to present findings effectively.
- **Provide Insights:** Offer insights that can help in understanding food-related behaviors and trends.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For any machine learning tasks if required.

## Analysis and Findings
### Demographic Trends
- **Gender-Based Preferences:** Analyzed the differences in food choices between male and female respondents.
- **Age Influence:** Examined how food preferences change with age.

### Key Factors
- **Income vs Spending:** Correlation between income levels and monthly spending on food.
- **Health Consciousness:** How health consciousness affects dietary choices.

### Visualizations
- **Bar Charts:** Used to show the distribution of favorite cuisines among different age groups.
